# Data Sources

This is just a sample of the various public datasets that are freely available online.

**Note:** I am not a big of using Kaggle datasets -- for several reasons. Often the original source of the data is not clear, so important context may be missing. There may already be analysis and visualizations attached to the dataset. Since Kaggle is so popular, if you use a project based on a Kaggle dataset on your resume, it may not stand out compared to many others who may have done something with the same dataset. My advice is to choose a topic that you are interested in (or interested in learning more about) and obtain data from original sources.
